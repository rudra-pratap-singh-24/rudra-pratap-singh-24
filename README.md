Hi, I'm Rudra Pratap Singh — a B.Tech student at Vivekananda Global University, currently in my second year.
I am passionate about technology, problem-solving, and building projects that improve my skills and create real-world impact.

I work with several programming languages and web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, C++, and Java.
I enjoy learning new concepts, exploring modern development practices, and creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications.

GitHub is where I document my learning journey, build projects, and continuously improve as a developer.
I look forward to collaborating, contributing to meaningful work, and growing in the world of software development.
